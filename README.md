# chip-8-emu
Just another chip-8 emulator. Created as a hobby project.

Very slow at the moment. Plays Chip-8 roms. Currently tested with UFO and PONG.

You can get roms from [here](http://www.pong-story.com/chip8/). Create a new folder from root as such /res/roms/ (you don't have to do this. it's just nicer this way).
